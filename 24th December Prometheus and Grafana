Launch Ubuntu 20.0. We will install prometheus on it.

Connect your machine via SSH.

Now follow below commands.

sudo apt-get update -y
(Update your EC2 machine)

sudo apt install Prometheus -y
(From this command both Prometheus & node-exporter will install in your system)

prometheus --version
(To check prometheus version installed)


systemctl status prometheus

systemctl status prometheus-node-exporter

Access Prometheus on 9090 port with public IP:9090


node_filesystem_avail_bytes{device="/dev/root",fstype="ext4",instance="localhost:9100",job="node",mountpoint="/"} / 1024^3



Now install grafana with following commands or you can follow official documentation link for the same. 
(https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/debian/)
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
sudo wget -q -O /usr/share/keyrings/grafana.key https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grafana.key] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
sudo apt-get update	
sudo apt-get install grafana


grafana-server --version
(To check grafana version)

If you want to check grafana previous versions then follow below document link.

https://grafana.com/grafana/download/10.2.3?edition=oss



We always prefer to open source grafana version but if you want to know when to use enterprise grade then you can refer grafana blog.

https://grafana.com/blog/2019/09/04/how-we-differentiate-grafana-enterprise-from-open-source-grafana/


We have install grafana. Now we need to start it. In order to access.

sudo systemctl start grafana-server
(From above command grafana will start)

sudo systemctl start grafana-server
(To check grafana current status)



Grafana runs on port 3000 and we can check it with below command

sudo apt install net-tools
(To install net tools)

netstat -ntlp
(We can see 3000 port is up and running)

Now if we want to access grafana from web, we have to open 3000 port in security group.

Access gafana from UI with public IP and port number 3000

When you access Grafana first time login with username & password as admin
First we need to add data source in grafana so click on Data Source and select Prometheus as Data Source.
Select Prometheus as Data source and its IP EC2 machine Public IP with port 9090.

Click on Save & Test. 

Now to Create Dashboard goto Dashboard section. 
New > Import > enter 11074 (You can any dashboard ID) > Click on Load
     Next Page Select your Saved data source (Prometheus) and Click on Import 
    You can see Dashboard is Import & its visualization as per your Dashboard ID you give.



☸️ Role Based Access in Grafana :-

how we can add users in Grafana

Goto Administration > Users and Access > User > New User

Enter name , Email , Username & Password

Now take one new incognito tab and login with that new user.


Alert Rule Set 
To Set Alert select any Graph and click on Edit.( We will take Disk Space Used % Basic graph)
Once you click on Edit you will go inside that particular graph & you can see Alert tab there. Click on that then Create New Alert Rule .

Click On Run Queries and make sure graph is reflected in alert page. If not you can delete if it has multiple Queries.
After Graph is showing set your thresholds parameters.

C= Reduce , Input = A , Function = Last , Mode = Strict
D=Threshold, Input = c , Function = Above = 20

Click on Preview where alert is fired or not based on number you select in Above fields. 

Set Interval time and evaluation time as 1 minute. Create Folder and Evaluation Group.
Click on Save rule and exit

SMTP in Grafana 
To set SMPT in grafana you need to create App password from Gmail. Kindly follow Gmail app password setup documents for details.

Once you have app password then goto your terminal and follow below steps.
You need to set SMTP in grafana configuration file to send Alert on Gmail.
cd /etc/grafana
ls
you can see gafana.ini file is here so we need to edit that with below command
sudo vi grafana.ini
Now goto SMTP section and edit following information
enabled = true
 host = smtp.gmail.com:587
user = yourid@gmail.com
password = <enter your 10 digit gmail app password>
Save and close 
Restart grafana with below command
systemctl restart grafana-server

We have configure SMTP in grafana now access grafana from UI


  Click 3 row line at left side cornor > Alerting > Contact Points 
Click on Edit of grafana-default-email

   We can see there is one default contact point is present click on edit symbol below Action name
Name and Integration would be Email

Once you receive test alert then goto Grafana UI and Click Save Contact Point
 Now follow Alert Rule Set section as explain above & set threshould on which your alert will fire and check if you receive alert in 1-2 minutes in your Gmail Inbox.


☸️ Steps to add new EC2 Instance in Prometheus :-

Launch new ubuntu 20.0 with node_2 and give security group with same name node_2 security Group and connect it with ssh

sudo apt-get update -y

➡️From below one by one command install only node exporter in it.

wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.6.1/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64
sudo mv node_exporter /usr/local/bin/

➡️ Now create one node exporter.service with below command.

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
(After file is created. Copy paste below content and save it )




[Unit]
Description=Node Exporter
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter --web.listen-address=:12345

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

---------------------------Start Node exporter service----------------------------------------------

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start node_exporter
sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
sudo systemctl status node_exporter

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now Take Public IP of prometheus server and in Node_2 server security group, allow 9100 to access it.

Edit Inbound rules >  type = custom TCP > port = 9100 > source = Custom <EnterPrometheuspublicIP> 
Save it

Now Goto Prometheus Server Terminal.

cd /etc/prometheus

sudo vi prometheus.yaml

At the end add below content

  - job_name: node_2
    # If prometheus-node-exporter is installed, grab stats about the local
    # machine by default.
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<node2publicIP>:9100']
  

Goto grafana server terminal and restart grafana service

sudo systemctl restart grafana-server

Now Finally access to Grafana Dashboard. In Dashboard we have tab to select instance
Origin_prom = None , JOB = node , Host = all

In that JOB field select node_2 in job drop down and you will get details of node_2 server.
